The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112).

The interaction of biotinylated-PIP3 analog (IP4) and the PIP3 binding protein brings both Acceptor and Donor beads together producing, upon excitation of the Donor beads at 680 nm, a singlet oxygen species leading to the luminescent AlphaScreen signal.

The phosphorylation of biotinylated-BAD (S112) peptide by full length recombinant Pim-1, Pim-2, or Pim-3 protein was detected with streptavidin:Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate and a europium (Eu) labeled antibody directed against phosphorylated-BAD (S112). Excitation of Eu by a high energy laser light (337 nm) leads to a transfer of energy to the APC molecule, and results in an emission at 665 nm. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of phosphorylated BAD peptide present in the reaction.Compounds were prepared in DMSO by conducting 3-fold serial dilutions to give a 10-point dosing curve having a high dose of 1 uM.

"1641705","598","103090","HTRF Biochemical Assay: The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384-well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser. Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 uL of 1.11x enzyme and 1.11x substrate in 1x assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate. After equilibration, 2 uL of 10xATP in 1x assay buffer was added to initiate the kinase reaction and the plates were shaken and then incubated at room temperature for 120 minutes. At the end of the incubation, 20 uL of 2x stop buffer (streptavidin-Dylight 650 (Thermo #84547B/100 mL), Eu-tagged pY20 antibody (Perkin Elmer #AD0067), EDTA, HEPES, and Triton) was added to quench the reaction.","B","10919","Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1","CHEMBL2835","H",8,"Autocuration","CHEMBL3888428",196
